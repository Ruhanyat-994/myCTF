## endianness
- **The term endianness describes the order in which computer memory stores a sequence of bytes**
- Big-endian: The most significant byte (the "big end") is stored first. For example, if you had the number 0x12345678 (in hexadecimal), in big-endian it would be stored in memory as `12 34 56 78`.

- Little-endian: The least significant byte (the "little end") is stored first. So, the same number 0x12345678 would be stored as `78 56 34 12` in little-endian.
- Use `reverse by character` and `to hex` in CyberChef.
