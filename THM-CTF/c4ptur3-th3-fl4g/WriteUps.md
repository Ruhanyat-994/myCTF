## Spectrograms
- Answer - `Super Secret Message`
- Here I have used dcode from my github

## Stegnography
- For this one we could use 
    - `steghide extract -sf stegosteg_1559008553457.jpg`
    - But it need a passphrase
    - We need to bruteforce it or we can use a website
    - `https://www.aperisolve.com/735f86f28e424dc6a376b546be938633`
    - now download the file 

- Answer - `SpaghettiSteg`

## Security through obscurity
- For this one I willl use aperisolve again
    - I'll do the same thing again and try to see the `strings` results
- Answer - `hackerchat.png`
- Answer - `AHH_YOU_FOUND_ME!`
