The error you're encountering, particularly the `RPC failed; curl 92 HTTP/2 stream 5 was not closed cleanly: CANCEL (err 8)` and `fetch-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet`, is usually related to issues with network connectivity, server load, or client-side limitations (e.g., Git configuration).

Here are some potential fixes:

### 1. **Increase Buffer Size**
Sometimes, the default buffer size for Git fetch operations is too small. You can increase the buffer size by running:
```bash
git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000
```
This increases the buffer size to 500MB.

### 2. **Disable HTTP/2**
Since the error involves HTTP/2, you can try disabling HTTP/2 for Git operations:
```bash
git config --global http.version HTTP/1.1
```

### 3. **Check Your Internet Connection**
Ensure that your internet connection is stable and not causing interruptions during the cloning process. If you’re on a slow or unstable connection, try using a different network or retry the clone operation later.

### 4. **Use Shallow Clone**
If the repository is large, you can try cloning it with a shallow copy (only the latest commit), which reduces the data being transferred:
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/thefileyouwant
```

### 5. **Check for Server-Side Issues**
The GitHub server may be experiencing high traffic or temporary issues. You can check GitHub’s status at [status.github.com](https://www.githubstatus.com/).

### 6. **Use SSH Instead of HTTPS**
If the issue persists, you can try using SSH instead of HTTPS for cloning the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:file/youwant
```
Make sure you have SSH keys configured for your GitHub account if you go this route.

Try one or a combination of these methods to resolve the issue. Let me know how it goes!
